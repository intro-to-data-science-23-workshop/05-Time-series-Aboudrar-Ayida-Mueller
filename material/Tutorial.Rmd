# TSIBBLE

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width ="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/tsibble.png")
```

We'll include three tasks of varying complexity, including clear questions and instructions, and provide example solutions using external datasets that can be downloaded from online sources.

Please note that you may need to install the required packages and dependencies. Make sure to have the `tsibble`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` packages installed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Install and load necessary packages
if (!requireNamespace("tsibble", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tsibble")
}
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}
if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
if (!requireNamespace("slider", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("slider")
}
if (!requireNamespace("datasets", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("datasets")
}
library(tsibble)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(slider)
library(datasets)
```

## Task 1: Simple Time Series Manipulation

**Question**: How can we load and manipulate a basic time series dataset using the `tsibble` package?

**Instructions**:

1.  Download the "AirPassengers" dataset, which is a basic monthly time series dataset, and load it into a tsibble.
2.  Create a new column that calculates the 12-month moving average of the number of passengers. (Hint: Use the slide_dbl from the 'library(slider)' in following way: lag(value, order_by = row_number()) %>% slide_dbl(.x = ., .i = 12, .f = mean, .before = 11, .complete = TRUE) )
3.  Plot the original time series and the moving average.

**Solution**:

```{r task1}

# Download the "AirPassengers" dataset
data("AirPassengers")


# Load the data into a tsibble
ts_data1 <- AirPassengers %>%
  as_tsibble(key = Month)

# Create a moving average
ts_data1 <- ts_data1 %>%
  mutate(moving_average = lag(value, order_by = row_number()) %>% slide_dbl(.x = ., .i = 12, .f = mean, .before = 11, .complete = TRUE))

# Plot the original time series and moving average
ts_data1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = value), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = moving_average), color = "red", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Airline Passengers and 12-Month Moving Average", y = "Number of Passengers")

```

## Task 2: Advanced Time Series Manipulation

**Question**: How can we handle a more complex time series dataset with missing values and multiple variables using the `tsibble` package?

**Instructions**:

1.  Download the "UKLungDeaths" dataset, which contains monthly deaths from lung disease, and load it into a tsibble.
2.  Handle missing values by interpolating them using linear interpolation.
3.  Create a new column representing the death rate (deaths per 1000 population) and plot it along with the original number of deaths.

**Solution**:

```{r task2}
# Download the "UKLungDeaths" dataset
data("UKLungDeaths")

# Load the data into a tsibble
ts_data2 <- ldeaths %>%
  as_tsibble(key = Month)

# Handle missing values by linear interpolation
ts_data2 <- ts_data2 %>%
  fill_gaps(value = "linear")

# Create a new column for death rate
ts_data2 <- ts_data2 %>%
  mutate(death_rate = value / 1000)

# Plot the original number of deaths and death rate
ts_data2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = value), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = death_rate), color = "red", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Deaths and Death Rate", y = "Number of Deaths or Death Rate (per 1000 population)")
```



# FABLE

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width ="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/fable.png")
```

Before we start, make sure to have the 'fable' package installed:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("fable", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("fable")
}
library(fable)
```

## Task 3: Basic Time Series Forecasting

**Question**: How can we make a simple time series forecast using the 'fable' package based on the previously manipulated time series data?

**Instructions**:

1.  Take the tsibble data from Task 1 in the previous answer (AirPassengers) and convert it to a 'fable' object.
2.  Fit an ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) model to the data.
3.  Make a forecast for the next 24 months.



**Solution**:

```{r task1}

# Fit an ETS model
forecast_ets1 <- ts_data1 %>%
  model(ETS(value))

# Make a 24-month forecast
forecast_24 <- forecast_ets1 %>%
  forecast(h = 24)

# Plot the forecast
forecast_24 %>%
  autoplot()
```

## Advanced: (no solutions here)

We will use the famous AirPassengers dataset, which contains monthly airline passenger counts from 1949 to 1960.

### Task 1: Analyzing the Data (1949-1955)

**Objective:** Fit a regression model with seasonal and trend decomposition to the data from 1949 to 1955.

**Instructions:** 1. Load the AirPassengers dataset. 2. Subset the data to include only the period from 1949 to 1955. 3. Create a tsibble object from the subset data. 4. Fit a regression model with seasonal and trend decomposition using `fable`. 5. Visualize the decomposition components.

```{r task1}


```

### Task 2: Making Forecasts (1956-1960) and Comparison

**Objective:** Generate forecasts for each month in the years 1956-1960 and compare them with the actual data.

**Instructions:** 1. Subset the data to include only the period from 1956 to 1960. 2. Create a tsibble object from the subset data. 3. Generate forecasts using the previously fitted model. 4. Plot the forecasts and compare them with the actual data from the AirPassengers dataset.

```{r task2}

```

**Hints:** - Use the `forecast()` function with the previously fitted decomposition model to generate forecasts.
